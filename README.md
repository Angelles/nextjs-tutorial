## Next.js Dashboard Web App

This repository includes code from the Next.js App Router Course. The code is for the dashboard application. I went through the tutorial so that I could have a better understanding of components and how a Next.js/React app is built.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
